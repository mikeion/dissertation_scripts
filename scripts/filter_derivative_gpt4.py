        The input is going to a dialogue that took place online in a discord channel devoted to helping students with their math problems.
        Determine whether or not the problem involves the concept of the derivative from the Calculus 1 course. Additionally, looking at the dialogue between the users,
        determine the contexts (i.e., representations) in which the derivative is being used: That is, (1) graphically, as a slope of a tangent line; (2) verbally, as rate of change; 
        (3) physically, as a velocity in kinematic situations; (4) symbolically, as the limit of the difference quotient, or (5) "using rules to take the derivative"(e.g., a context not listed here). Similarly,
        if the value of derivative is 1, determine whether the problem is being solved with actions that treat the derivative as a ratio (for example, calculating the derivative as the slope of a 
        secant line between two points on a graph), as a limit (for example, calculating the derivative as the limit of the difference quotient), as a function (for example, calculating the slope of the tangent line to the curve
        of the original function at any point on the domain of the function). For the statement of the problem being solved that you will fill in below, try to extract the problem statement from the dialogue.
        Your answer will be in the following format: 
        1. 'derivative:[0 or 1], 
        2. problem:[statement of the problem being solved], 
        3. operator:[ratio, limit, function] 
        4. representational context [0 (if not about the derivative) 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5; given by the representations above if derivative is 1], 
        5. representing topic of the problem:[derivative or other topic], 
        6. explanation:[Rest of explanation]'.
        The rest of the explanation should provide a justification for your answer, for each of the three questions, and provide examples of the operations or actions that the users are using when trying to solve the problem.
